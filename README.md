# Class Planner / Optimizer

## Group Members
Sean Dougherty and Jake Kinzler

## Overview
Our objective is to make an app for students that could be used to optimize their schedule and understand where and when their classes are. This app consists of four main sections, as well as an import schedule page that allows the user to upload their class schedule (from NOVO).

### Planner Section
Our first section displays the student's schedule for today, and they can choose any day of the week to display as well. They are also able to update their schedule within this section by manually entering updates using forms or by importing a schedule on the import schedule page. 

### Optimizer Section
Our second section is the Optimizer feature for the user. This section contains information about the user's schedule and also allows the user to view the locations of all events on their schedule.

### Directions Section
Our third section allows the user to select two buildings on cmapus, and it provides them with an embedded map of directions to navigate between the two buildings.

### Authorization Section
The authorization section contains login and register pages that allow the user to create an account and login to our application so they can add information for their scheudle and get personalized results

### Upload Page
The user can use the import schedule page to import a class schedule from NOVO. There are instructions on this page that instruct the user how to obtain the appropriate .ics file, and once the user has this appropriate file, they can enter this file and upload it to the application. This results in each of the classes from teh .ics file being added as an event to the student's schedule in the application

### Future Ideas
We could add functionalities for tracking what materials are needed for class on the selected day for the student to bring with them, and potentially automatically schedule meal times based on user perferences and time to eat. We also want to eventually implement responsive design elements so the application can be easily used with mobile devices.
