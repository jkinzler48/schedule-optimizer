# Class Planner / Optimizer

## Group Members
Sean Dougherty and Jake Kinzler

## Overview
Our objective is to make an app for students that could be used to optimize their schedule and understand where and when their classes are. This app consists of three sections. 

### Planner Section
Our first section displays the student's schedule for today, and they can choose any day of the week to display as well. They will also be able to update their schedule within this section.

### Optimizer Section
Our second section is the Optimizer feature for the user. This section contains information about the user's schedule and also allows the user to view the locations of all events on their schedule.

### Directions Section
Our third section allows the user to select 2 buildings on cmapus, and it provides them with an embedded map of directions to navigate between the two buildings.

### Authorization Section
The authorization section contains login and register pages that allow the user to create an account and login to our application so they can add information for their scheudle and get personalized results

### Future Ideas
We could add functionalities for tracking what materials are needed for class on the selected day for the student to bring with them, and potentially automatically schedule meal times based on user perferences and time to eat



# Information on Getting Started with Create React App:
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
